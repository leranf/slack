### Slack Challenge

# A simple excercise of making an http request to a public API (Flickr), organizing the data, and then visualizing it in a grid.

# If an image is clicked, it will open in a lightbox viewport. The user can navigate through the grid using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons. To exit the lightbox, simply click the image again.

# The UI is responsive. As the vertical view gets smaller, elements are moved to the bottom of the grid, and can be viewed by scrolling down the page.

## Run

# Fork and clone the repo
# Add a config/config.js file with your flickr API_KEY and USER_ID
# In scripts/eventListeners.js change the PHOTOSET_ID to an album id from your account 
# Open the index.html file in your favorite browser
